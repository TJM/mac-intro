## WIP - Monitoring as Code (MaC) & k8s CI/CD Implementation

## Purpose
This repo attempts to lay a general framework to play with a MaC Implementation and is broken down into the following parts...

- GKE Cluster Creation
- Flux CI/CD Installation -> installs various k8s resources
- Grafana Dashboarding/Alerts/Notifiers as Code Implementation
- WIP -> GCP Alerts/Monitoring Implementation
- WIP -> GCP Dashboard Auto Provisioning

## But really? Why cloud monitoring as code?
Cloud resources are meant to be expendable, being spun up/down at will (pets vs cattle) while also being provisioned with speed and precision. This is achieved in an organizationally standardized and repeatable manner as code while also being made more widely available to more teams through merge requests with governance/approval processes.
In the end, managing infrastructure as code allows cloud resources to be dynamic, follow an enterprise standard, have governance at all levels by SMEs, have versioning, and be better prepared for a disaster.

## Before You Begin
In order to install the example Mac implementation, you must have access to a GCP Project, and either [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell) or [CloudSDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart)

- This requires that you a google cloud project to work with. Google offers a free tier of GCP (one per each Gmail account) that equates to $300 of free resources -> [link to sign up for gcp trial](https://cloud.google.com/free)

- Since this uses GCP as the cloud provider, you must have Google CloudSDK installed -> [quickstart link](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart)


## Getting Started
To get started, simply fork this repo, clone locally, and execute the following:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This will create a GKE cluster and hook up flux CI/CD to the forked Github repo and deploy the releses contained under `/releases`

At this portion of the install, you will be expected to provide a [Github Persional Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) - so have one handy.
